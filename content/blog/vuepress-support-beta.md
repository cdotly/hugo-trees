[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) support is here! üéâüéâüéâ

Support for Static Site Generators (SSGs), beyond Jekyll and Hugo, was on our roadmap for a while now. In fact, Jordan mentioned adding other SSGs to Forestry back when our first beta was [leaked on Producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/forestry#comment-320289) two years ago.

_Why did you make us wait?_ We love to create a great content management experience and make an app that is as easy-to-use for developers as it is for editors. That's why until now other features (e.g. [blocks](https://forestry.io/blog/blocks-give-your-editors-the-power-to-build-pages/), [cloudinary integration](https://forestry.io/blog/cloudinary-integration/) or [editing in teams](https://forestry.io/blog/renaming-files-and-improving-team-editing/)) were given priority.

_Why VuePress?_ VuePress is a simple and easy-to-learn SSG that gets you up-and-running in no time. This simplicity made adding support for VuePress a lot more manageable. Additionally, since it generates content from markdown files with YAML front matter, it's a great fit for our existing editor.

This is a big announcement for us and we're looking forward to hearing what you have to say about it. Feel free to reach out to us via the `Support` section in your sidebar, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forestryio) or our [Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/forestry-community/shared_invite/enQtNDAxMTU5NzcwMzA3LWUyYTk3NDY2ZDNiMjFhNmVlMjExM2FjYzFhNjJhNjU2NTc2ODVjZTdlYjJiODhhZDgwYTVhYjY0ZGU3ZWFmYzM). Now, let me walk you through importing your first VuePress project in two steps.

<div id="ELEMENT_ID" data-proofer-ignore>
{{% create_site_button
repo="https://github.com/forestryio/portfolio-vuepress.git"
engineName="vuepress"
engineVersion="0.12.0"
heading="You don't have a VuePress Project?"
linkText="Add Forestry's VuePress Portfolio Theme" %}}
</div>

## Add Headings and Single Documents to Your Sidebar

We also made a few other changes. Now, you can create custom headings in your content sections and add single files to your sidebar. Read more in the [docs](https://forestry.io/docs/settings/content-sections#type)
