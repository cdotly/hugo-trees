Happy New Year! We're starting into 2019 with an exciting new feature.

Today we can announce support for S3 as an image storage provider for Forestry. The S3 integration makes it possible to efficiently store, organize and deliver images while keeping the editing experience in Forestry simple and clean.

Editors, marketers and writers can continue to use the Forestry Media Library without even knowing that they are using S3 in the backend. This makes it possible to use drag & drop for uploads and offers previews for their images.

With S3 support you can now store your images outside of your repo and take control of your image handling. S3 Buckets are widely supported and therefore allow you to add additional services for your images. A popular choice for on-the-fly transformations is the image delivery and manipulation service [imgix](https://docs.imgix.com/setup/quick-start). Try it out and let us know what you think.
